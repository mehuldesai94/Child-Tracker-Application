# Child-Tracker-Application
This is a new product which is developed for the parents. Expected impact of the product is to automate existing manual processes of tracking their child/children when they leave a particular location. This software is to ease the stress of parents having to worry about the whereabouts of their child/children when are moving from one location to the other.
